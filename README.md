# FX Empire 

Full-stack home assignment for FX Empire. Language: JavaScript. Workframe: React JS.

My initial idea was to work with React redux-thunk but after designing the functionality of this web application I have decided that using those technologies probably will be useless because of the simplicity of the application and the simple state of the application. 
It took me a while to understand and work with Highcharts library but after this assignment, I feel more confident and working and building graphs with disorganized data. 

## Dependencies:

- axios,
- highcharts,
- highcharts-react-official,
- node-sass,
- react,
- react-dom,
- react-loading,
- react-router-dom,
- react-scripts,


I used react-router-dom if I needed to expand and create more complex and larger scaled applications with different routes.

For efficiency, I saved the graph data, which came from FX Empie API, on the session storage which helped me create fast application with unnecessary calls for the API. 

This Application was designed by me. The Application is responsive for mobile use (max-width:480px) and for screen larger then 1000px

I developed this application on Windows machine and Chrome developer browser. Everything has been tested and work as I designed on my end.
